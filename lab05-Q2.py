# equal to the original two-digit number.



# The main function
def main():

        for i in range(1,10): # checking each number from the number range
            some = (i + 9) + (i * 9) 
            if ((int(some / 10) == i) and (some % 10 == 9)): # checking if has the same values as the two variables
                lst.append(some) # adding the correct number to the list

        lst.sort(reverse=True) # reversing the list to make it in decending order
        return(lst) # returning the final list so it can be displayed

    
    # Printing the result returned by special_digit
